# Blocks, Procs, Lambdas -- Oh My!

# based on a presentation I made in Sept 2012 to the Austin 
# Ruby & Rails MeetUp group

# Blocks, Procs, Lambdas are confusing at first -- 
# yet, you secretly know you'd be
# better off if you grokked this.  Here's a quick overview of 
# the differences and similarity of these three siblings from
# the Closures family.

# read examples in this order: Blocks, Procs, Lambdas, Closures
# each file contain one example illustrating a point
# you can run each set of code with:
#  ruby <file_name>.rb

# Take-aways:
#
# 1 Lambdas have strict parameter checking and weak returns
# 2 Procs have no parameter checking and strong returns
# 3 Blocks and Lambdas are just anonymous Procs
#
# 4 There is much deeper insight -- but let this sink in first
